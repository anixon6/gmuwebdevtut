#What is SSH?  

First off SSH stands for Secure Shell Protocol. SSH is the protocol used to communicate between UNIX machines. UNIX is an operating system just like Windows or Mac. SSH provides a encrypted channel to talk between a client and a server (like the Mason Cluster). SSH does not use a graphical interface unlike Windows Remote desktop.
